# Contributing to cntmosaic

Thank you for your interest in `cntmosaic`. This is a preliminary (v0.5) release shared with
collaborators and early users. Contributions in the form of bug reports and feature requests
are very welcome.

## Reporting a Bug

If you encounter unexpected behaviour, please [open a bug report](https://github.com/ShozenD/cntmosaic/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

Before submitting, please:
- Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/ShozenD/cntmosaic/issues) to see if the bug has already been reported.
- Include a minimal reproducible example if possible.
- Include the output of `python -c "import cntmosaic; print(cntmosaic.__version__)"` and your Python version.

## Requesting a Feature

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement, please [open a feature request](https://github.com/ShozenD/cntmosaic/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

Please describe:
- The problem you are trying to solve or the use case you have in mind.
- How you would expect the feature to behave.

## Questions

For questions about usage or methodology, please open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/ShozenD/cntmosaic/discussions) rather than an issue.

## Code Contributions

Code contributions via pull requests are welcome, but please open an issue first to discuss
the proposed change. This avoids wasted effort if the change is out of scope for the current
development priorities.

When submitting a pull request:
1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.
3. Add or update tests for any changed behaviour.
4. Run the test suite before submitting: `pytest`.
5. Follow existing code style (enforced by `black` and `flake8`).
