class IGMRF2D(Distribution):
    """
    2-dimensional Intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Field (IGMRF) distribution.

    This distribution represents an isotropic Gaussian Markov Random Field over a 2D
    lattice. The precision matrix Q has the form:

        Q = cond_prec * (L₁ ⊗ I₂ + I₁ ⊗ L₂)

    where L₁ and L₂ are Laplacian matrices constructed from finite difference operators
    of the specified order, I₁ and I₂ are identity matrices, and ⊗ denotes the Kronecker
    product.

    The distribution is intrinsic (improper) because the combined Laplacian L₁⊗I₂ + I₁⊗L₂
    has zero eigenvalues corresponding to polynomial trends of degree less than the order
    (for order=1, just the constant/overall-mean direction). `sample()` draws directly
    from the reduced eigenspace orthogonal to these trends, so its output automatically
    satisfies the corresponding constraint (a sum-to-zero constraint when order=1).
    `log_prob()` assumes `value` already satisfies it too -- it does not check or project
    for this, it simply computes the proper density on that reduced subspace, so any
    component of `value` along the null space is silently ignored (see `log_prob`'s
    docstring for details).

    Mathematical Background
    -----------------------
    An IGMRF models spatial correlation through finite differences. For a 2D grid,
    the precision matrix penalizes roughness in both dimensions with a single shared
    conditional precision:

    - order = 1: penalizes first differences (random walk prior)
    - order = 2: penalizes second differences (smooth prior)

    Because L₁⊗I₂ and I₁⊗L₂ share the eigenvectors U₁⊗U₂ (where U₁, U₂ are the
    eigenvectors of L₁, L₂), the combined eigenvalue for eigenvector U₁[:,i]⊗U₂[:,j] is
    λ₁[i] + λ₂[j]. This eigenvalue is zero only when *both* λ₁[i] = 0 and λ₂[j] = 0, so the
    null space has dimension order² (not simply the product of independently-truncated
    subspaces). The reduced eigenspace used for sampling/likelihood is therefore built by
    filtering the combined eigenvalues by a small tolerance, rather than slicing each
    dimension's eigenvectors independently.

    If `rescale_marginal_variance=True`, `L` is additionally rescaled so that the
    geometric mean of the diagonal of its generalized inverse (the marginal variances
    implied by `L` at `cond_prec=1`) is 1, following Sørbye & Rue (2014). This makes
    `cond_prec` comparable across different `num_nodes`/`order` choices, since without
    it the same `cond_prec` value implies different amounts of smoothing depending on
    grid size and order.

        Initialize a 2D Intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Field distribution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_nodes : tuple[int, int]
            Number of nodes in the grid for each dimension (n₁, n₂).
            Must be greater than order.
        order : int
            Order of the finite difference approximation, shared by both dimensions.
            Must satisfy: 0 < order < min(num_nodes).
        loc : ArrayLike, optional
            Location parameter (mean) of the distribution. Default is 0.0.
            Shape options:
            - Scalar (): broadcasted to (batch_shape, n₁ * n₂)
            - (n₁ * n₂,): no batch dimension
            - (batch_shape, n₁ * n₂): batched means
            The flattened grid uses row-major (C) order.
        cond_prec : ArrayLike, optional
            Conditional precision (inverse variance) parameter controlling smoothness.
            Default is 1.0. Shape options:
            - Scalar (): no batch dimension
            - (batch_shape,): batched precision parameters
            Must be positive.
        tol : float, optional
            Tolerance for filtering near-zero eigenvalues of the combined Laplacian.
            Eigenvalues below this threshold are treated as null and excluded from
            sampling and likelihood computations. Default is 1e-10.
        rescale_marginal_variance : bool, optional
            If True, rescale `L` (and its eigenvalues) so that the geometric mean of
            the diagonal of `L`'s generalized inverse
            `Sigma = U_sub @ diag(1 / lam_sub) @ U_sub.T` (the marginal variances at
            `cond_prec=1`) equals 1, following Sørbye & Rue (2014). This makes
            `cond_prec` comparable across different `num_nodes`/`order` choices.
            Default is False.
        validate_args : bool, optional
            Whether to validate input arguments. Default is None.
            When True, checks parameter constraints (e.g., positive precision).

        Compute the log probability density of the IGMRF2D distribution.

        `Q = cond_prec * L` is rank-deficient: `L` has an `order²`-dimensional null
        space spanned by polynomial trends of degree less than `order` in each
        dimension (e.g. just the constant vector when `order=1`), which is what makes
        this an intrinsic (improper) GMRF. The density below is therefore the proper
        Gaussian density on the `reduced_dim = n1*n2 - order²`-dimensional subspace
        orthogonal to that null space, i.e. it implicitly assumes `value` has already
        been constrained to that subspace (a sum-to-zero constraint for `order=1`;
        higher-order polynomial-trend constraints for `order>1`). This is *not*
        checked or enforced here: because the null space of `L` is exactly the kernel
        of `Q`, any component of `value - loc` lying in it contributes nothing to the
        quadratic form and is silently ignored.

        Using the reduced-rank formulation over the `reduced_dim` non-zero eigenvalues
        `lam_sub` of `L`, the log density is:

        log p(x) = -1/2 * [reduced_dim * log(2π / cond_prec) - log|L₊| + cond_prec * (x - μ)ᵀ L (x - μ)]

        where `log|L₊| = sum(log(lam_sub))` is the precision-independent pseudo
        log-determinant of `L`; `cond_prec`'s contribution to the full pseudo
        log-determinant `log|Q₊| = reduced_dim * log(cond_prec) + log|L₊|` is carried
