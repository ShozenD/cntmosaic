What is Contact Mosaic?
-----------------------

Contact Mosaic (``cntmosaic``) is a Python package for modelling, simulating, and visualising
social contact data. It provides tools to load and preprocess contact survey data, infer
social contact matrices using Bayesian models, and evaluate and visualise results.

Models are implemented using `NumPyro <https://num.pyro.ai/en/stable/index.html>`_, enabling
both Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) based full Bayesian inference and fast stochastic
variational inference (SVI).
